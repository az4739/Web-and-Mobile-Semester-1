                        <p>Blue Monday has become a cultural icon of electronic music. One of the first songs that implement the kind of electronic music that shapes the future. Everyone knows Blue Monday, not by song name but by the recognisable kick it
                            starts with.</p>
                        <p>Fully electronic and digitally produced, these kicks have a certain repetition cycle that is notable and has been used many times after the initial release of Blue Monday.</p>
                        <p> The new order is a band famous for the implementation of different genres, music instruments and different ideas in their music. One of the most influential sounds from that period of music can be heard from blue Monday.</p>

                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="references-item">
                    <div class="references-info">

                        <p> As the music scene was changing, New order was changing with it. Clubs became bigger, sound systems developed and the demand for bigger and stronger music was up. The music of that time could not keep up with the quantity of decibels
                            speakers could produce at the time. The audience was a story to itself.</p>
                        <p> Dancers on the dancefloor could not keep to themselves and were never satisfied. In times like these, the New order decided to create an “old-new” song. The song was almost completely created from electronic sounds yet played the
                            old fashion way. The bass flows naturally as if it was played with a real instrument. Still, the sound of it is purely electronic, distorted and most importantly, new. The impact of this was huge. </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="references-item">
                    <div class="references-info">
                        <p>It appealed to both audiences at the time, the young hyper generations that were coming and demanded new sound, and the older generations who can still hear the familiar basslines under all that electronic noise. This was satisfying
                            because we as humans look for repetition, and as species like the familiar things. </p>
                        <p> is important to notice that the song itself was groovy heaven. People from all over the world could dance to its beats without knowing the lyrics. This was achieved by, again the electronic rhythm machine that was responsible for
                            replacing the drums. All in all, the song was and still is a mega-hit that connected the world. Its magical sounds can be heard and recognised all over the globe and it led many new artists to develop their sound inspired by
                            Blue Monday.

                        <p> At the time of the single's release, this vocal impact become heard internationally. The most effective use of autotune at that music period can be heard in this song. there is no other vocals as corrected by autotune as in "One

                        <p>The predominant riff is a split of a brass section from a funk band from the '70s chopped up and rearranged, volumed down a tiny bit to distort timbre, and looped to the point where it is a completely new,</p>

                        <p> particular and difficult to pinpoint sound, actually completely removed from its starting place in "More Spell on You" Somewhere withinside the first act of the song, there is a "double beat drop".</p>
                        <p> This is a completely different approach to the standard 4/4 music because it destroys the whole concept of a 4/4 beat(visit Mixing for dummies to learn about 4/4 and the importance of it).On the downbeat of the first chorus, after
                            the tambourine break (1:02),

                        <p>the beat drops in with a kick-snare-tambourine combo, however it changes by 1:10 where an extra layer of kick and snare pattern is layered over the primary kick. This has an uplifting effect and gives you that serotonin punch.</p>

                            The watery, synthy sounds at 2:05 follow the horn riff, closely low-pass filtered. The bridge reputedly blew people's minds in 2000, together with Niles Rodger himself. It's a surprising flip withinside the music of that time that brings a completely
                            new feeling of strength and unity to the listener The lyrics are universally understood as a non-violent imparting of letting music unite everyone, which describes all of Daft Punks work as an entity.

                        <p>A hit song by Gala, Freed from desire had a huge impact on modern electronic music for a different reason from New orders Blue Monday. The arrangement. Freed from desire was a hit song because of its famous vocals and the interesting
                            humming that was so universal everyone could enjoy it.</p>
                        <p> The importance of this song in history can be found in its arrangement of the parts of the song. The most famous part of the song, the vocals are not as important as the impact it had on the people. Without knowing about it, the
                            listeners were presented with a new, not so standard, arrangement of modern electronic music. This arrangement was built with one thing in mind. </p>

                        <p>Easier mixing. Again, the new ages were coming and there was a demand for change in standard music. The most famous way of performing in a club was a Djing. Still, DJs had a problem, the songs they had at that time were short,
                            snappy and fast. (Learn more about this on the Mixing for dummies page of this website)</p>
                        <p> There was no time for a Dj to perform because the songs were going fast and the Dj could not keep up. Freed from desire changed this. Gala saw the struggles Djs have with short songs so they decides to change this. A long intro
                            with only the beat can be heard as the beginning of the song, this is not usual because the intro of the song is the one that will buy the audience attention. </p>

                <div class="references-item">
                    <div class="references-info">

                        <p> This decision was made to help Djs perform their song in the most important places for the music scene at the time, the clubs. To get back the attention of the audience from that long and boring intro, Freed from desire has recognisable,
                            relatable and easy to learn lyrics.</p>
                        <p>
                            All combined, Gala and Freed from desire managed to control the audience and learn them to love things that the industry needed at that time. Nowadays, Freed from desire is considered to be one of the most influential songs that at the same time capture
                            the feel of transition from analog to digital and yet force the change to its listeners.
