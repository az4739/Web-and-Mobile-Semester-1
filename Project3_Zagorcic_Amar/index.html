                <p>This site is created to open doors into electronic music to an average music consumer that does not come upon electronic often in their playlists, but still consumes a lot of it without knowing. The site will be sprinkled with music recommendations
                    from this genre and will encourage the user to listen to music while browsing through the site </p>

                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                    <p>Electronic music has become a part of our daily lives. It has infested our day the same way technology has. Those 2 terms depend on each other.</p>
                    <p> The birth of electronic music could not have been possible without the development of technology. You cant make bread without making wheat first.</p>
                    <p>Electronic music is one of the many children the technology has. It happens to be the creative one, this is what makes it so interesting. </p>

                <div class="service-item">
                    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                    <p> How can a computer create sound? As far as I know, electricity does not have a sound, and even when it does, it is in a form of thunderstruck or electricity cracking (Both not good and certainly not enjoyable).</p>
                    <p> Electronic music has evolved to such an extent that today, you can't even tell if the sound is “Real” anymore.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-item">
                    <h2>Explained</h2>
                    <p>Electronic music is created the same way any other digital form is. In the pure essence of it, it is very simple.</p>
                    <p> It works on zeros and ones, as most of the technology does. What is interesting about it is the way it works. Imagine electricity running. It forms a wavelength. The main parts of a wave are amplitude and wavelength.</p>
                    <p> “Amplitude, in physics, is the maximum displacement or distance moved by a point on a vibrating body or wave”.</p>
                    <p> It can be represented as a 1, or a peak of a wave. Amplitude by itself is not that interesting. When a wave comes to that point, it can be recorded and you can hear a sound from it. A pop sound can be heard. The part that makes it
                        interesting is the wavelength.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="service-item">

                    <p> These amplitudes are equally distributed in space, so if you manage to control the length of them, you can, in theory, create a repeating sound and create a rhythm.</p>
                    <p>If you shorten the wavelength to the point that there is no hearable transition between two peaks, you can create a sound. The fast oscillations of electricity is what creates a purely digital sound.</p>
                    <p>This is just the beginning of the electronic sound. That signal is processed and manipulated many times so that you can achieve the sound you want.</p>
