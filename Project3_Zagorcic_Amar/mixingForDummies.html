                        <h2>Music</h2>
                        <p>To understand what does a Dj do in his booth, you first need to understand how does music itself works. Most modern music is written in 4/4. That means that there are 4 beats equally distributed in one bar. These will be essential
                            if you want to mix successfully. Another important part of music is time. Time in music is noted with BPM, or beats per minute. This is as the name implies, how many beats, or kicks, are there in one minute. </p>

                        <h2>equipment</h2>
                        <p>For example, a 120 BPM song will have 120 beats in one minute of a song. To mix two songs you need to align these 2 things. To help you with these tasks, DJs use equipment that can control the speed of the song as well as align
                            the beats of the song. Back in the day, this was done with vinyl and turntables. This was a hard skill to master so not everyone could be a Dj. The process was really physical and required a literal slowing down of the vinyl
                            by pressing down. Nowadays, technology has replaced turntables and it has become a lot easier to do this. </p>

                        <h2>What to do When terminators rule ?</h2>
                        <p>With computer power, the alignment of these two parameters has become automatic and a lot easier for a lot more people to start Djing. But this is a blade with two sharp sides. On one hand, you have all that computer power and
                            don't have to bother about these things, you can concentrate on other important parts of this performance. On the other hand, beat matching is the essential part of this performance and if it fails (Which happens in some cases)
                            you cannot do anything else. So it is very important to learn and practice this skill so you don't find yourself in a sticky situation.</p>

                        <h1>Part 4</h1>
                        <h2>Press play</h2>
                        <p>Without further ado, let's start. When you want to mix 2 songs together you need to have next: two different songs (It would be nice if you already know them). These songs can be played on many different devices but the most important
                            thing is that they can be played simultaneously. These two devices send their sound to a mixer, (Usually between them), The mixer's main role is to control the volume of songs. You can turn up and turn down the volume on it.
                            This is the only thing you will need for now. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-img">
                        <img src="images/cueplay.jpg" alt="img">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="project-item">
                    <div class="project-info">
                        <h1>Part 5</h1>
                        <h2>Press play again</h2>
                        <p>Start your first song. As it plays pay attention to its BPM (Beats per minute) and the beat of the song itself. You can usually read the BPM of the current song playing on the screen of the device that is playing that song. Now,
                            before playing the second song, you first need to prepare it. Set the BPM of the second song to the same BPM as the song currently playing. This is important because without this step you cannot perform the next steps. Now
                            you need to listen to the current song playing.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="project-img">
                        <img src="images/repeat.gif" alt="img">

                        <h1>Part 6</h1>
                        <h2>close</h2>
                        <p> Watch for the first of the 4 beats in one bar. Usually beats 1 and 3 & 2 and 4 are the same. You can concentrate on any of them. Set the starting point of the second song to the first beat of the song. When you get the feel of
                            and feel ready, start the second song on one of the first beats of the song playing. IF done successfully, the second song should start playing in time with the first song. Note that all this is happening in your headphones
                            and the audience can't hear this part. After a little bit of fiddling, you have both songs playing at the same time.</p>

                        <h1>Part 7</h1>
                        <h2>Cool</h2>
                        <p>The final thing to do is to slowly turn up the volume of the second song on the mixer component, so the audience can hear it as well. When you feel like it, start decreasing the volume of the song that was playing in the beginning
                            until you are left with just the second song playing.
                        </p>

                            Congrats, you have successfully performed your first mix. Of course, there are many more parameters that can be played with, other techniques learn, and many more things. But the essence of it is in this and if you don't know the basics of mixing, you
                            cannot continue the process.
