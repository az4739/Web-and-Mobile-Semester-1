                <h2>Synthesizer</h2>
                <p>The Minimoog is one of the most influential vintage synthesizers. Its design is the template that influences many synthesizer manufacturers to this day. With three oscillators, a noise generator, and possibly the best sounding filter ever
                    created, the Mini put synthesizers within the reach of the gigging musician. It singlehandedly added the sound of electronic music into the mainstream. Thanks to the Minimoog, electronic music was allowed to run become what it is today
                    and people started accepting it.</p>
                <p> The mini was created from bits and bobs from Moog's massive modular systems. Bill Hemsath was a worker in Moog responsible for its creation. He wanted a portable instrument that he could take home. He couldn't have known that he was creating
                    a legend. What makes the Mini so great? A number of things. First, its relatively limited number of parameters makes it pretty easy to use. Second, the sound was great. Though many instruments are said to be possessed of a special
                    and inclusive character, the Minimoog really has it.</p>
                <p>The oscillators are rich, and the envelopes are snappy. Its highs are piercing and crystal clear, and the bass has rightfully become the sound of a legend. It's big, ballsy, and it's pretty hard to make it sound bad.

                <h2>Drum machine</h2>
                <p>
                    Roland's TR-808 is recognized worldwide and is used pretty often to this day, Either as the original or as sampled as the distinctive 808 sound it remained in demand since its creation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Roland's 808 drum machine introduced one of the world's best step sequencers to the world. Its unique, synthesized percussive sounds are like a unique branding that sets the 808 apart from other drum machines. Although the overall sound was part of its
                    appeal a large draw for many was the 808's ability to produce really low frequencies with its bass drum noise.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The 808 also gained popularity for its cheaper price, though it was still $1,195 at the time, opening it up to wider audiences. Although it has been used by artists across all genres the 808 has marked it-s legacy particularly in hip-hop where it's still
                    used today by artists like Kendrick Lamar and Kanye West. </p>

                <p>
                    3 years after releasing the 808 Roland followed up with the even more refined 909 that has had a similar, though less high profile, legacy. The 909 introduced sample-based hi-hats and toms, improved sound-shaping options, and MIDI implementation. The
                    909 shaped the sound of techno and house for years to come.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These two classics have been used by countless artists, including Marvin Gaye, David Byrne, Janet Jackson, Aphex Twin, Beyonc√©, Dr Dre, Taylor Swift, Outkast, Beastie Boys, and many many more. </p>

                <h2>Synthesizer</h2>
                <p>Robert Moog invented the first true commercial synthesizer in 1964 using the newly affordable transistors that were becoming available, and in doing so implemented the fundamental synthesis concepts that are still in use today: the voltage
                    controlled oscillator, the voltage-controlled filter, the low-frequency oscillator, envelope generators and more.</p>
                <p> This set the basic pattern for all analogue synthesizers to follow, and for many digital ones too. Initially, this synthesizer technology was only of interest to avant-garde composers such as Herbert Deutsch, who helped Moog design his
                    first instruments. But over the course of the 1960s, as Moog (and other manufacturers) refined the capabilities of the synthesizer, their sounds started to feature on pop records.</p>
                <p>They often took the musical role of a fancy electric organ or for special effects. A notable early use of a Moog Modular was by the Beatles on 'Here Comes the Sun'. The descending pitch tone heard at the end of the intro is apparently
                    because the unreliable oscillators wouldn't hold their pitch after a note was played - but the Beatles liked the unintended effect and kept it in.

                <h2>Synthesizer</h2>
                <p>Roland TB-303 has the main role in the evolution of dance music. The phrase 'acid house, is the one that can tell the most about this machine</p>

                <p>The noteworthy facts about the TB-303 are that it was designed as a stand-in bass player for use at band practice. At this task, it was signally useless and any band member suggesting its use would probably be immediately dismissed, along
                    with their ridiculous silver box.</p>

                <p>The resulting mountains of unwanted TB-303s piled up in the secondhand music shops of the world, but in Chicago, they were picked up cheaply by DJs and producers looking to create the new 'house' music style rapidly becoming popular in
                    the early 1980s. Marshall Jefferson reports that he bought his in a pawnshop for $100 and subsequently sold it to Bam Bam for $1,000 - yes, after the acid-house boom!</p>

                <p>Maybe it was only a matter of time before someone stumbled on the hypnotic squelch of the future generated by the TB-303 given that synths often offered simple arpeggiation and step-sequencers. But as it happened it was DJ Pierre who discovered
                    its effect and released the result as the record 'Acid Tracks' under the name Phuture in 1986. DJ Ron Hardy had previously played a prototype version of the tune at the Chicago club Music Box a reputed four times. The first play received
                    bafflement, but by its fourth outing the roof was raised, and a new genre had been born.</p>
